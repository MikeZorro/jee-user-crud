Hello,

This project is a web API that helps manage users database.

The app allows you to view a list of users, edit each user, look into user details and delete users. 
The delete action is safe guarded with additional validation from the user.

The design and front end features are build with Bootstrap library.

I have used User DAO(data access object) that I have build previously to connect MySQL database with java code.
Next I created servlets using Tomcat and all the pages in jsp with jstl.
The view includes all interactive buttons and a link to my page in a sidebar.
